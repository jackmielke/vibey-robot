"""
reachy_chat.py — voice-to-voice conversation with Vibey.

You talk (laptop mic) → faster-whisper transcribes → Claude thinks up a short
reply in Vibey's persona → ElevenLabs renders it in Vibey's voice → it plays
from the robot's speaker. The mic is muted while Vibey speaks so it doesn't
hear itself.

Run in the handsfree venv (has sounddevice + faster-whisper + anthropic):

    .venv/bin/python3 reachy_chat.py

The brain resolves in this order:
  1. ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (from .env or env)  → Anthropic SDK
  2. `claude` CLI                          → works after `claude /login`
  3. echo mode                             → repeats what it heard (no brain)

Config (.env or environment):
    WONDER_MODEL     default claude-sonnet-5 (set claude-haiku-4-5 for snappier replies)
    WAKE_WORD        optional — e.g. "wonder"; if set, only reply when heard

Fast mode (toggle from the dashboard, or FAST_MODE=1 to start in it): skips
whisper + Claude entirely and hands the raw utterance straight to an ElevenLabs
Conversational AI agent (its own realtime STT+LLM+TTS), which tends to be both
snappier and more reliable than round-tripping through a local model + a CLI
subprocess. See ELEVEN_AGENT_ID below.
